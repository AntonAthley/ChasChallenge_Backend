    title: "Air Quality Index",
    info: "The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized indicator of overall air pollution. It combines data from various pollutants—such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and more—to give a single number that reflects how clean or polluted the air is, and what health effects might be a concern for the public.",
  },
  humidity: {
    title: "Humidity",
    info: "Humidity refers to the amount of water vapor present in the air, expressed as a percentage. High humidity can make the air feel warmer and promote mold growth, while low humidity can cause dryness in skin and respiratory passages. Ideal indoor humidity typically ranges from 30% to 60%.",
  },
  temperature: {
    title: "Temperature",
    info: "Temperature indicates how hot or cold the air is, measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. It plays a vital role in comfort, energy usage, and the behavior of other air quality factors like humidity and VOC levels.",
  },
  pressure: {
    title: "Air Pressure",
    info: "Air pressure, or atmospheric pressure, is the force exerted by the weight of air in the atmosphere. It's measured in hPa (hectopascals) or millibars. Changes in air pressure can affect weather conditions and are sometimes linked to physical discomforts such as headaches or joint pain.",

  tvoc: {
    title: "Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC)",
    info: "Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) represent a wide range of organic chemicals that can easily become vapors or gases. They are emitted by products like paints, cleaning supplies, furniture, and even humans. High TVOC levels can cause eye, nose, and throat irritation, headaches, and in some cases, long-term health effects.",
  },
  eco2: {
    title: "Equivalent Carbon Dioxide (eCO₂)",
    info: "Equivalent Carbon Dioxide (eCO₂) is an estimate of CO₂ concentration based on the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Unlike actual CO₂ measurements, eCO₂ is calculated using sensor algorithms and is used as an indirect indicator of air freshness and occupancy. It's typically expressed in parts per million (ppm).",
