    title: "Air Quality Index",
    info: "The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized indicator of overall air pollution. It combines data from various pollutants—such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and more—to give a single number that reflects how clean or polluted the air is, and what health effects might be a concern for the public.",
  },
  humidity: {
    title: "Humidity",
    info: "Humidity refers to the amount of water vapor present in the air, expressed as a percentage. High humidity can make the air feel warmer and promote mold growth, while low humidity can cause dryness in skin and respiratory passages. Ideal indoor humidity typically ranges from 30% to 60%.",
  },
  temperature: {
    title: "Temperature",
    info: "Temperature indicates how hot or cold the air is, measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. It plays a vital role in comfort, energy usage, and the behavior of other air quality factors like humidity and VOC levels.",
  },
  pressure: {
    title: "Air Pressure",
    info: "Air pressure, or atmospheric pressure, is the force exerted by the weight of air in the atmosphere. It's measured in hPa (hectopascals) or millibars. Changes in air pressure can affect weather conditions and are sometimes linked to physical discomforts such as headaches or joint pain.",
  },
  tvoc: {
    title: "Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC)",
    info: "Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) represent a wide range of organic chemicals that can easily become vapors or gases. They are emitted by products like paints, cleaning supplies, furniture, and even humans. High TVOC levels can cause eye, nose, and throat irritation, headaches, and in some cases, long-term health effects.",
  },
  eco2: {
    title: "Equivalent Carbon Dioxide (eCO₂)",
    info: "Equivalent Carbon Dioxide (eCO₂) is an estimate of CO₂ concentration based on the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Unlike actual CO₂ measurements, eCO₂ is calculated using sensor algorithms and is used as an indirect indicator of air freshness and occupancy. It's typically expressed in parts per million (ppm).",
  },
  pm1: {
    title: "PM1",
    info: "PM1 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 1 micron or less. These ultrafine particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, potentially causing respiratory and cardiovascular issues.",
  },
  pm2_5: {
    title: "PM2.5",
    info: "PM2.5 includes particles that are 2.5 microns or smaller in diameter. They are a key component of air pollution and can deeply penetrate the respiratory tract, leading to health problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and heart disease.",
  },
  pm4: {
    title: "PM4",
    info: "PM4 encompasses airborne particles with diameters of 4 microns or less. While less commonly used as a standard, it bridges the gap between PM2.5 and PM10 in particle size assessments.",
  },
  pm10: {
    title: "PM10",
    info: "PM10 consists of particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less. These can include dust, pollen, and mold. They are inhalable and can cause respiratory irritation and other health effects, especially in sensitive individuals.",
  },
  nc_0_5: {
    title: "Particle Count ≥ 0.5μm",
    info: "Indicates the number of particles with a diameter of 0.5 microns or larger per cubic centimeter of air. Useful for identifying levels of fine dust and smoke.",
  },
  nc_1_0: {
    title: "Particle Count ≥ 1.0μm",
    info: "Measures the concentration of particles that are 1 micron or larger, helping to assess overall air cleanliness and filter performance.",
  },
  nc_2_5: {
    title: "Particle Count ≥ 2.5μm",
    info: "Represents the number of particles 2.5 microns or larger per cubic centimeter. Often associated with larger fine particles like mold spores and pet dander.",
  },
  nc_4_0: {
    title: "Particle Count ≥ 4.0μm",
    info: "Counts airborne particles that are 4 microns or larger. These particles are often filtered by HVAC systems but can still indicate dusty environments.",
  },
  nc_10_0: {
    title: "Particle Count ≥ 10.0μm",
    info: "Refers to coarse particles like dust, pollen, and other allergens that are 10 microns or more in diameter.",
  },
  typical_particle_size: {
    title: "Typical Particle Size",
    info: "The average or most common size of particles detected in the air, expressed in microns (µm). Helps indicate whether pollution is dominated by ultrafine or coarse particles.",
  },
